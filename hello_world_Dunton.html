        <p>From an early age, I was immersed in the world of technology and mechanics, growing up in an automotive repair shop where I developed a keen understanding of machines and problem-solving. My passion for technology led me to join the U.S. Marine Corps as a Radio Operator, where I honed my technical skills under high-pressure situations.
        After my military service, I pursued a new passion in brewing beer. A self-taught brewer, I combined my mechanical aptitude and love for technology to revolutionize
        the brewing process, integrating advanced systems to enhance quality and efficiency. This innovation led to the successful opening of my own brewery, where I blended tradition with cutting-edge tech.
        Now I am transitioning into the world of Cyber Security, leveraging my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to protect digital infrastructure and systems.With a background rich in hands-on experience and technological integration, I am poised for success in this dynamic field.
