      <p><strong>I have been studying to learn how to program in different languages for the last few years now.
        I have learned basic fundamentals to the process of learning to program in python, HTML, and VisualBasic.
        I am currently learning Java and a more indepth course in HTML. As this pursuit evolves I will be updating this site to devlop my portfolio.
